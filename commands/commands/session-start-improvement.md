Start a new improvement/refactoring session by:

1. Check current branch is develop: `git branch --show-current`
   - If not on develop, checkout develop first: `git checkout develop`
   - Pull latest: `git pull origin develop`

2. Create improvement branch: `git checkout -b improvement/$ARGUMENTS`
   - If no arguments provided, ask for improvement name

3. Create session file in `.claude/sessions/` with format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-improvement-$ARGUMENTS.md`

The session file should begin with:
