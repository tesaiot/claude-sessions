Start a new bugfix development session by:

1. Check current branch is develop: `git branch --show-current`
   - If not on develop, checkout develop first: `git checkout develop`
   - Pull latest: `git pull origin develop`

2. Parse arguments to extract issue number and description
   - Format expected: "123 description" or just "description"
   - If has issue number: branch name = `bugfix/123-description`
   - If no issue number: branch name = `bugfix/description`

3. Create bugfix branch: `git checkout -b [branch name]`

4. Create session file in `.claude/sessions/` with appropriate name
